# Loupe Status

Last verified: 2026-05-22.

Loupe is a runtime E2E harness for iOS Simulator apps. The current product
surface is the `loupe` CLI plus the injected runtime server.

## Current Capabilities

- Launch simulator apps with injection through `loupe start` or
  `loupe launch --inject`.
- Assign an available localhost port on launch, record the runtime under
  `~/.loupe/runtimes`, and resolve later commands by `--bundle-id`, `--udid`,
  or `loupe use <bundle-id>`.
- Capture full snapshots, compact observations, accessibility trees, visible
  screen maps, screenshots, layout audits, runtime logs, and action traces.
- Query and inspect nodes by `testID`, text, role, or ref.
- Dispatch simulator-visible `tap`, `swipe`, `drag`, and `type` through Loupe's
  native host-side HID backend.
- Resolve action targets through the accessibility tree first, then fall back to
  the view tree when needed.
- Save action traces with before/after snapshots, accessibility trees, logs,
  screenshots, action records, diffs, and target crops when available.
- Run quick route sweeps with `loupe explore-routes`.
- Try allowlisted UIKit property mutations at runtime with `loupe set` and
  `loupe set-many`; property mutations animate by default and report effective
  state.
- Inspect and mutate Auto Layout constraints with `constraints`,
  `set-constraint`, and `deactivate-constraint`, including effective-state
  verification.
- Reflect verified runtime mutation experiments back toward source with
  `loupe reflect`.
- Install the Codex/Claude skill with `loupe skills install`.

## Supported Verification

The repository post-change gate is:

```bash
scripts/verify-agent-work.sh
```

It runs:

- `swift test`
- release CLI build
- runtime injection smoke E2E
- native HID and UIKit scenario E2E
- bookmark app-style E2E

GitHub Actions uses the same command for the `Post-change E2E` required check.

## Design And UI Iteration

For design or screenshot-driven work, the expected loop is:

```bash
loupe capture-report --bundle-id com.example.App --output loupe-report
loupe screen-map loupe-report/snapshot.json --limit 120
loupe tree loupe-report/snapshot.json --view --depth 6
loupe inspect loupe-report/snapshot.json --test-id key.control
loupe audit loupe-report/snapshot.json
loupe screenshot --udid booted --output loupe-screen.png
```

Use screenshots for visual sanity and the view tree for actionable checks:
frames, hierarchy, fixed chrome, scroll containers, colors, corner radius,
clipping, and UIKit metadata.

## Current Limits

- iOS Simulator only; physical devices are out of scope.
- `loupe pinch` keeps the intended API shape but HID dispatch is not implemented.
- Native `UIAccessibility` container traversal is opt-in with
  `LOUPE_NATIVE_ACCESSIBILITY=1`; the default runtime path uses Loupe's
  view-derived accessibility tree.
- SwiftUI movement/input selectors depend on elements exposed through the
  accessibility tree. Loupe does not synthesize private SwiftUI view selectors.
- Screenshot baseline diffing is not implemented yet.
- Layout audit is useful for obvious issues, but it does not yet fully encode
  spacing, alignment, typography, z-order intent, clipping, or truncation rules.
- Layout-owned frame and Auto Layout mutations may be restored by UIKit. Loupe
  reports requested and effective state; only effective changes should guide
  source edits.
