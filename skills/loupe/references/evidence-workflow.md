# Evidence Workflow

Use this when deciding what Loupe evidence proves and what to capture next.

## Capture

```bash
$LOUPE ui report --host <host> --output /tmp/loupe-report
$LOUPE ui query /tmp/loupe-report/snapshot.json --test-id target.id
$LOUPE ui node /tmp/loupe-report/snapshot.json --ref n21
```

Saved snapshots are positional arguments for read-only `ui` commands; reserve
`--snapshot` for ref-based actions and mutations. `ui report` writes JSON plus
screenshots when supported; macOS host runtimes may need JSON-only proof.

## Visibility And Targeting

- Prefer `testID` when available. Use text/role for discovery, then switch to
  stable `testID` or current-snapshot `ref`.
- Raw `isVisible` can include dismissed sheets or reused offscreen cells. For
  current-screen claims, use default `ui query`, `compact`, `screen`, `audit`,
  hit-test evidence, screenshots, or a fresh report.
- `ui hit-test` and `ui responder-chain` are live-runtime evidence; pass
  `--host`, `--udid`, or `--bundle-id`, not a saved snapshot path.
- If overlays, alerts, menus, sheets, or keyboards may cover a target, hit-test
  before acting and recapture after acting.
- If screenshot-visible controls are missing from default query, inspect with
  `--include-hidden`, hit-test/focus the point, then prove state with trace plus
  fresh report/screen/node evidence.

## SwiftUI And Bridges

- Screenshot-visible text, buttons, metadata, or rows may be absent from both
  view and accessibility text queries. Treat that as a semantic boundary, not a
  blank app.
- Claim queryability only when `ui query`, `ui screen`, a stable accessibility
  ID, or a probe proves it.
- Use bridge controls, hit-tests, coordinate traces, screenshots, app-authored
  probes, logs, or defaults to prove workflows.
- Treat `ui audit` on SwiftUI-hosted internals as triage. Empty
  `ui reflect sourceCandidates` can be correct for framework wrappers or
  synthetic probes.

## App-Authored Probes

- Import path: public `.loupeProbe(...)` from `LoupeKit`.
- No-import path: local `UIViewRepresentable`/`NSViewRepresentable` fallback
  with accessibility identifier/label/traits.
- Notification path: post `dev.loupe.probe` / `dev.loupe.removeProbe` with
  measured bounds. Synthetic nodes are structural locators, not platform views,
  so activation and mutation can correctly fail.
- Probe payload keys: `id`, `label`, `role`, `frame` with `x/y/width/height`,
  and optional `isInteractive`.

## Diagnostics

For no-import runtime logs, post `dev.loupe.log` with `["message": "..."]`,
then collect with `debug logs --host <host> --output <logs.json>`.

`debug network` collects app-authored `dev.loupe.network` events and LoupeKit
fixture URLProtocol events; it is not a general packet sniffer.

Use `debug refs`, `object-graph`, `leaks`, `keychain`, `defaults`, or `flags`
only when the app or task contract names that evidence/key. These are
app-scoped diagnostics; empty output can be a valid bounded result.
